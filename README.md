# Predictive Healthcare Analytics: Modeling Patient Outcomes
## Overview
Predicting patient outcomes is a crucial task in healthcare that can have a significant impact on improving patient care. By developing models that can predict patient outcomes, such as mortality or disease progression, providers can tailor treatment plans to individual patients and improve overall outcomes.

This project aims to develop predictive models that leverage healthcare data to improve patient outcomes. The models will be based on various factors such as demographics, comorbidities, and treatments. The project will use advanced analytics techniques, such as machine learning, to achieve this goal.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

* Develop predictive models that can accurately predict patient outcomes based on various factors such as demographics, comorbidities, and treatments.
* Use the models to tailor treatment plans to individual patients and improve overall outcomes.
* Evaluate the performance of the models and refine them as necessary to improve their accuracy and effectiveness.
