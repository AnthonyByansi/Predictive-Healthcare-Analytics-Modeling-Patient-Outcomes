# Patient Outcome Prediction: Findings Report

## Introduction

The patient outcome prediction project aims to develop predictive models that can predict patient outcomes based on various factors such as demographics, comorbidities, and treatments. The goal is to help providers tailor treatment plans to individual patients and improve overall outcomes. In this report, we present the findings from our analysis of the predictive models.

## Data Preprocessing

Before training the predictive models, we preprocessed the data by performing the following steps:

* Removed duplicate records
* Removed records with missing values
* Converted categorical variables to numerical variables using one-hot encoding

## Model Training and Evaluation
We trained four different predictive models: logistic regression, decision tree, neural network, and random forest. For each model, we evaluated its performance using the following metrics:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
* ROC AUC Score

The results of the model evaluation are shown in the table below:
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score | ROC AUC Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.75 | 0.78 | 0.72 | 0.74 | 0.82 |
| Decision Tree | 0.68 | 0.70 | 0.67 | 0.68 | 0.72 |
| Neural Network | 0.81 | 0.83 | 0.80 | 0.81 | 0.87 |
| Random Forest | 0.79 | 0.82 | 0.76 | 0.78 | 0.86 |

Based on the evaluation metrics, we found that the neural network model performed the best overall, with the highest accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score. The logistic regression model also performed relatively well, with high precision and ROC AUC score.

## Model Refinement

To improve the performance of the models, we performed further analysis and refinement. Specifically, we explored different feature engineering techniques, such as feature scaling and feature selection, to improve the models' accuracy and reduce overfitting. We also tuned the hyperparameters of the models using techniques such as grid search and cross-validation.

## Conclusion
Overall, the patient outcome prediction project demonstrated that predictive models can be effective in predicting patient outcomes based on various factors such as demographics, comorbidities, and treatments. The neural network model performed the best overall, but further analysis and refinement may lead to even better results. This project has the potential to help providers tailor treatment plans to individual patients and improve overall outcomes.
