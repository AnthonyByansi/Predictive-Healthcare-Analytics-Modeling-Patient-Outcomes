# Methodology Report
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict patient outcomes using various machine learning algorithms. In order to achieve this goal, we followed the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. This methodology consists of six phases:

* Business Understanding
* Data Understanding
* Data Preparation
* Modeling
* Evaluation
* Deployment
In this report, we will discuss each of these phases in more detail and explain how we applied them to our project.
