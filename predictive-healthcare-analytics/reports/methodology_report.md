# Methodology Report
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict patient outcomes using various machine learning algorithms. In order to achieve this goal, we followed the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. This methodology consists of six phases:

* Business Understanding
* Data Understanding
* Data Preparation
* Modeling
* Evaluation
* Deployment
In this report, we will discuss each of these phases in more detail and explain how we applied them to our project.

## Business Understanding

In this phase, we identified the business problem that we are trying to solve. We defined the problem as predicting patient outcomes based on various factors such as demographics, comorbidities, and treatments. We then identified the stakeholders who would benefit from this prediction, which include healthcare providers, insurance companies, and patients themselves.

## Data Understanding

In the data understanding phase, we obtained the necessary data and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a better understanding of the data. We identified missing values, outliers, and potential issues with the data that would need to be addressed during the data preparation phase.


## Data Preparation

In the data preparation phase, we cleaned the data, handled missing values and outliers, and performed feature engineering to create new features that may be relevant for predicting patient outcomes. We also split the data into training and testing sets to prepare for the modeling phase.

## Modeling

In the modeling phase, we applied various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree, neural network, and random forest, to the training data. We fine-tuned the hyperparameters of each algorithm using cross-validation to obtain the best possible performance.

## Evaluation

In the evaluation phase, we evaluated the performance of each model using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score. We compared the performance of each model and selected the best performing model to be deployed.
