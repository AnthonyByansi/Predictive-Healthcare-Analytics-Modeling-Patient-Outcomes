# Methodology Report
## Introduction
The goal of this project is to predict patient outcomes using various machine learning algorithms. In order to achieve this goal, we followed the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. This methodology consists of six phases:

* Business Understanding
* Data Understanding
* Data Preparation
* Modeling
* Evaluation
* Deployment
In this report, we will discuss each of these phases in more detail and explain how we applied them to our project.

## Business Understanding

In this phase, we identified the business problem that we are trying to solve. We defined the problem as predicting patient outcomes based on various factors such as demographics, comorbidities, and treatments. We then identified the stakeholders who would benefit from this prediction, which include healthcare providers, insurance companies, and patients themselves.

## Data Understanding

In the data understanding phase, we obtained the necessary data and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a better understanding of the data. We identified missing values, outliers, and potential issues with the data that would need to be addressed during the data preparation phase.
